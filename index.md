Hey there! Welcome to my research & learning blog.

This blog is mostly about topics that I have a huge passion for: 
- **asset pricing theories**
- **empirical methods in financial market**
- **portfolio construction**. 

With the hope to motivate myself for deeper and more structural thinking in these topics and to share the joy of getting to know more with you, I plan to maintain this blog activly. Any critics, comments and discussions on content would be sincerely appreciated.
