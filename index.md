Hey there!

Welcome to my **research and learning blog**, where I'll be sharing my thoughts and learnings on topics from **portfolio construction techniques**, **Statistical method**, or **asset pricing**. 

The aim is to challenge myself to engage in further structured thinking on the aforementioned topics, while also sharing my journey of learning with others who share my passion for these subjects.

While my primary goal is to use this blog as a tool for personal development, I'm also excited to connect with like-minded individuals and would welcome feedback, suggestions, and critique. I hope that you find this blog informative and thought-provoking. 

Thank you for joining me on this journey. Hope we all find joy along it.
