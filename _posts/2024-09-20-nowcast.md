### The "Big Hit" <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we have explored the impressive capabilities of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid recession.

The Covid recession is probably unlike any other economic downturn in history. While most recessions are driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much alarm, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the entire economy came to an abrupt halt.

This shock was vividly reflected in macroeconomic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummeted to 41, far below the contraction threshold of 50. A clear fat-tail event - the kind that would mess up the estimation of a model. Moreover, the sectoral pattern of economic activities was highly unusual. Sectors typically seen as acyclical such as service and consumption experienced larger contraction, employment no longer lags production, unprecedented liquidity injected to the public sector... etc. Traditional models are ill-equiped to handle such an anomaly!

This raises the critical question: how can we adapt our models to handdle such extreme shocks? What's the way to produce reasonable estimation with crises like Covid in the data? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers valuable insights into these challenges.

Initially introduced in April 2016, the New York Fed's nowcasting model provided weekly nowcast of US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, a new, more robust version of the model was released, designed to better handle such extreme period. Let's take a closer look at what has changed.

### Here Comes the Change <a name="change"></a>

To appreciate the improvements in the updated model, it's helpful to take a quick review on the original version.

The original version is based on a fairly standard dynamic factor model. Macroeconomic indicators are modeled with two components: the latent factors $$f_t$$ that stands for comovement and the idyosyncratic disturbance $$\epsilon_t$$, which reflect individual series-specific noise. Both components follow autoregressive process with invariant Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$) for their own evolution. Special restrictions are applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ during estimation to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure as well as to incporate quarterly data in a monthly flow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

The advantage of such a parsimonious Gaussian linear system is clear: its simplicity minimized estimation uncertainty, and the Gaussian framework kept calculations tractable, ensuring analytical convenience. Given the small T big P data set at hand, it seems to be a pretty reasonable choice - at least at that time.

However, like any model, it does have its own limitation, which became glaringly evident during the Covid recession. The unprecedented scale and unique sectoral patterns of the Covid recession overwhelmed a system built on invariant parameters. Dramatic fluctuations caused distortions across the entire model, influencing how macroeconomic indicators were interpreted and diggested. To make matters worse, the parameters of this model were re-estimated quarterly using a rolling 15-year window of data. This meant that the model’s estimates would carry the distortions caused by Covid for the next 15 years.

Given this context, it's not surprising that the New York Fed suspended this first generation of model shortly after Covid-19 hit. A much-needed update followed, resulting in a new version that remains a dynamic factor model but incorporates significant structural changes to handle rapidly evolving volatility and shifted sectoral dynamics more effectively.


**Stochastic Volatility and outlier adjustment**

One of the most significant updates to the New York Fed's nowcasting model is the explicit incorporate of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustments. 

Rather than relying on Gaussian noise with invariant variance, the updated model introduces the time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) to account for shifting level of volatility. In addition, discrete outliers multiples ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$), which can take values between 1 and 5 allow for further scalling of fluctuations during extreme events.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

This update pushs the model beyond the Gaussian linear realm, but the benefits are substantial. It shields the model from overemphasizing periods of extreme volatility. After all, volatility is the ruler in all estimation and prediction. A distorted volatility estimate due to short-term spikes can disrupt the entire parameter estimation process, leading to skewed forecasts.

By incorporating time-varying volatility and outlier adjustments, the model is better equipped to handle large fluctuations. Sharp, rapid changes—such as those seen during the Covid recession—are now interpreted more locally, reducing the likelihood that these events will distort the broader model or influence forecasts for unrelated periods. 

**Factor Structure**

Another significant change is the introduction of a "Covid factor" to capture the unique economic dynamics of the pandemic. This factor was active only from March to September 2020, and it affected most economic indicators, except inflation.

Maroz, Stock & Watson(2021) found that despite the different pattern, scale and timing of the Covid recession and its immediate aftermath, a single Covid factor can explain much of the unique comovement during the Covid time. They found that such a Covid factor is significant from Mar to June 2020 and phase away afterward, generally alined with New York Fed's choice from March to September. With the Covid factor, the unique structure of the Covid recession is mostly remained for the Covid period hence we are not asking traditional questions on this exaggerated data.

This is vividly demonstrated in the evolution of latent factors and volatility plots. After adding the Covid factor, the extreme fluctuation observed in global factors that load on all macroeconomic indicators is absorbed from the Soft factor that loads on survey indicators into the newly added Covid factor, illustrating the varied responses of different indicators to the pandemic.

Additionally, the New York Fed has added a long-term growth trend factor, which only loads on GDP and GDI indicators, to capture changes in long-term growth.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t & = \mu + l g_t + \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
g_t &= g_{t-1} + r_g v_{gt} \\
v_{gt} & \sim N(0,1)
\end{aligned}
$$

Just based on the estimation of the long term trend for the past 15 years, the demand of adding such a factor is not urgent. The long term growth rate stays around 2.6% with a relatively wide 90% probability band. The impact will be limted even without this long term growth factor.

The intent is probably to have more data used for the estimation. With all the new structure added. It becomes both natural and important to load more data in the estimation. For one hand, the model is now well equited to accomodate special periods in the past characterized by high fluctuation. For the other, the significant more parateters and non-Gaussian feature require more data for reliable estimation. 

This is exactly what New York Fed has done in their model update. Rather than using rolling 15 years of data for estimation, they swithced to the whole sample for the estimation. The nececeity of dealing with diferent long term growth rate start to revel with a longer and growing data set.
