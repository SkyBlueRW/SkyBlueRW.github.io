### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid Pandemic.

The Covid recession was probably unlike any economic downturn in the history. While most recessions are driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much alarm, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

This shock was reflected dramatically in macroeconomic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummeted to 41, far below the contraction threshold of 50. This was clearly a fat-tail event - one that would overwhelm even the most well-designed models.

The question that arises is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such extreme shocks? How can we produce reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers valuable insights into tackling these challenges.

The New York Fed initially introduced its first generation nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, a new, more robust version of the model was released, designed to better handle such data fluctuations. Let's take a look at what has changed.

### The Model Before Covid <a name="before"></a>

To appreciate the improvements, let's first review the original model.

The first version was actually a fairly standard dynamic factor model. It modeled macroeconomic time series through two components: a comovement compornent $$f_t$$ and the idyosyncratic component $$\epsilon_t$$, both of which followed autoregressive process with invariant Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions were applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ so that latent factors only linked to their corresponding macro series to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

This is essentially a parsimonious linear system with Gaussian uncertainties. The simplicity of the model reduced estimation variance and provided stability. The assumption of Gaussian uncertainties made the calculation process tractable, ensuring computational convenience. This approach should work well under normal conditions but is actually ill-equiped to handle extreme situations.

With such a paradighm, a 31% GDP drop is obviously an extreme outlier - an occurrence so improbable that it heavily skews the estimation, rendering the corresponding period disproportionately influential. Making matters worse, the parameters of the model are re-estimated every quarter with a rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

Given this context, it's not surprising that the New York Fed suspended the first generation of their model shortly after the oneset of Covid-19 for a much-needed update.

### Here comes the change <a name="change"></a>

So what does the new model look like? It's still a dynamic factor model but now comes with significantly more structures.

The most crucial update, aimed squarely at handling uprecedented fluctuations in data, is the explicit incorporation of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustment. In the previous model, both latent factors and idiosyncratic components were modeled with Gaussian noise of 0 mean and constant variance. The new version, on the other hand, introduces the time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) to account for changing volatilities and discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) that can take value of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 as multiplier to further enhance its ability to cope with extreme shocks. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, this update drives the model beyond the Gaussian linear realm, but the benefit is also substantial. It helps to alleviate the exaggerated influence of the crisis period on the estimation of the model. with constant volatility defined in the previous Gaussian linear system, large fluctuations in the data would inevitably mess up the estimation of all parameters. Specifically, in front of a big fluctuation across the board of many macro economic series, an exaggeerated proportion of the impact would rush into the estimation of latent factors simply because that's most of the flexibility lies by design of the model (moving them around would provide better improvement in terms of likelihood in the estimation of this scenario!).

While this does not seem to align with the real story. Our markets operate under continuusly changing distributions, occasionally punctuated by sudden jumps of shocks. A recent economic downturn should implies more about the local information about this special time of economic activities rather than a story about unconditional trend, the latter of which is usually driven by something else like population and productivity. It's like standing at today of 2024, we don't want to base our judgement on a model predominatly relying on the Covid quarter for its estimation.

The incorporation of time-varying volatility helps to guard against the excessive emphasis on large-fluctuation period. For instance, an extreme fluctuation in a single macroeconomic series can be (partly) attributed to a spike in the idiosyncratic volatility of that series. Similarly, widespread fluctuations across many series can be tied to increased volatility in the latent factors driving those series. The introduction of discret outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) further enhances the model's ability to respond to extreme events, allowing for volatility amplification through outlier multiples, just as their name suggests.

**add the covid factor**



Other than it works really well, new source of unvertainty

long term growth trend of US real GDP, loads only on the US real GDP. Not expict since 1985. But might be important considering that it is expanding on estimation data.

non-diagonal 


messing up the estimation. simply trim them out is not a good idea, as they come with meaniful economic content. 

how to treat

Covid recession is fundamentally different than other recessions

Pandemic is unprecedented event.
