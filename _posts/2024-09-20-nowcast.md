### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid Pandemic.

The Covid recession was probably unlike any economic downturn in the history. While previous recessions were typically driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much warning, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

This shock was reflected starkly in macro economic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI fell to 41, well below the contraction threshold of 50. This was clearly a fat-tail event - one that would disrupt even the most well-designed models.

The key question now is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such unprecedented shocks? How can we arrive at reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers a valuable opportunity to explore these challenges.

The New York Fed initially introduced its first generation nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, the New York Fed released a more robust version designed to better handle data volatility. Let's take a closer look at what has changed.


### The Model Before Covid <a name="before"></a>

To understand their improvements, let's first have a quick lookt at the original model.

The first version was actually a fairly standard dynamic factor model. It modeled macroeconomic time series through two components: a comovement compornent - $$f_t$$ and the idyosyncratic component $$\epsilon_t$$, both of which followed autoregressive process with Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions were applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ so that latent factors only linked to their corresponding macro series to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Essentially, this was a parsimonious linear system with Gaussian uncertainties. The simplicity of the linear structure helped to reduce estimation variance, providing stability to the model. The assumption of Gaussian uncertainties made the calculation process tractable, offering significant computational convenience. This approach should worked well for the majority of time, but not in an extreme situation.

With such a paradighm, a 31% GDP drop is obviously a fat tail event - an occurrence so improbable that it heavily skews the estimation, rendering the corresponding period disproportionately influential. This is a system built to process gradual, normal changes but now flooded with extreme volatility, leading to unreliable estimates and nowcast. What's worse, the parameters of the model are set to be re-estimated every quarter with rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

With this context, it's not that surprising to see New York Fed suspending the first generation of model soon after the Covid for an update.

### Here comes the change <a name="change"></a>

So what's the new model look like? It's still a dynamic factor model but with much more additional structures. 

The most important update, right at the target of handling unprecedented fluctuation, is the explicit modeling of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustment added. Compared to the old version model where both latent factors and idyosyncratic components are modeled with standard Gaussian noise of invariant variance, the new version of model incoporated time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) and discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$).

In addition to the standard Gaussian distrubance ($$e_{ft}, e_{\epsilon t}$$), the time-varying volatilities accounting for volatility clustering and the discrete outlier ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) that can take value of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 are multiplied together to model the shocks.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Obviously, such modeling shifted us away from the Gaussian linear realm. The benefit is tremendous. In the previous Gaussian linear system, a large fluctuations would be passively taken as a extreme fat tail event under an invariant distribution, leading to significant impact on the following estimation and model interpretation. 

The new modeling aligns much better with the real world. We are in a market with continously chaging distribution with occasional jumps. In addition to small chance event from random samplling, a large flutuation can also originated from the change of the distribution itself and a lot of times both! After all, we have witnessed too much 'once in a hundred' time event suggested by an invariant Gaussian distribution in the financial market.

The time-varying volatility opens the possibility for such scenarios. In this case, a standard alone fluctuation of a macroeconomic series can be attributed to hiking volatility of the idyosyncratic component of the sereis while a fluctuation spreaded among many macroeconomic series can be attributed to the hiking volatility of corresponding. The discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) further enhace the model's ability to adapt to extreme flutuations. Volatility can be amplified in multiples with changing discrete outliers as their name 'outlier' suggest.

nonlinear element. account for the fact of normal

**add the covid factor**



Other than it works really well, new source of unvertainty

long term growth trend of US real GDP, loads only on the US real GDP. Not expict since 1985. But might be important considering that it is expanding on estimation data.

non-diagonal 


messing up the estimation. simply trim them out is not a good idea, as they come with meaniful economic content. 

how to treat

Covid recession is fundamentally different than other recessions

Pandemic is unprecedented event.
