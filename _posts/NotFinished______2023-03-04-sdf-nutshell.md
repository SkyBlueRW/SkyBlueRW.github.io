## Stochastic Discount Factor: a nutshell of asset pricing 


1. [P = E(mx)](#introduction)
2. [The origin](#ma)


### P = E(mx) <a name="introduction"></a>

It all starts with $$P_t = E_t(m_{t+1}x_{t+1})$$! 

At the heart of many interesting topics in finance such as factor pricing models, market anomalies, return preidiction, time variant risk premimum..etc lies this fundamental asset pricing formula. 

It is amazing that with such a neat equation based on few assumptions, one can price all future payoffs $$x_{t+1}$$ with a stochastic discount factor $$m_{t+1}$$. Through the len of the paradigm with stochastic discount factor, we can extend insights across asset classes from different perspectives such as macro, consumption, production... 

Throughout this blog, I would like to kick off the discussion on the subject of asset pricing with a focus on stochastic discount factor. Where does it come from? what's the implication? how to allign it with real world? are the questions that we hope to address. 


### The Origin <a name="ma"></a>

There are actually several ways to get to the asset pricing formula. I will begin with the one that is based on mimimum assumption and gradually build upon it with more perspectives. 

In its most general form, as long as portfolios with the same payoff have the same price (Law of One Price) there exists such a random variable of stochastic discount factor that prices all payoffs. Let's swtich to the state space of random variable for the intuition. Remember that up to the point t, both $$x_{t+1}$$ and $$m_{t+1}$$ remain unknown with different potential realizations in various scenarios.
