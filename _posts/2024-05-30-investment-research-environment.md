### Where it begins <a name="beg"></a>

The idea emerged a couple of years ago when I started to have some research results and hoped to do more! Those 'hard lifting' like tracking on-going performance of existing reserach and clearning data for new research seem more and more repeatative and tedious. Hence my wondering - wouldn't it be amzing to have a system to scale on all of it so that more time is spent on the main part?

Now the question is where to start. It is true that research projects are distinct in nature. Different modeling is applied on various data set to answer different questions. 


The project is nowhere near to finish yet and by no means I am trying to develop a well optimized product level system. It's indeed helpful. What's already there make my life easier in research and the process of development prepared me to learn and do the coding for all my research.

### What do I need <a name="need"></a>

modularized

1. pre data - api
2. tools, likely use existing tools - modularization. Historical backtest. No gaurantee, but do
3. monitor new clues about effective paper trading.

I have dedicated some time every once a while to the development of this system imagined in the next couple of years. There is a distinct kind of fun from the development than from a research project. In research, the excitement a lot of time is from finally understanding something or figuring out a solution, the aspiration arrives as a nice surprise after reading and verifying into the data. While when it comes to development, the joy of satisfaction arives gradually. With every line of new codes written, I feel I get a little bit close to this.
