### Where it begins <a name="beg"></a>

The idea emerged a couple of years ago when I started to have some research results and hoped to do more! Wouldn't it be amazing to have a system to scale on monitoring existing research results and facilitating new research? As much as I hate to admit, investment research, is not only about the excitement of thinking and experimenting with solution of puzzles. There is also a quite heavy aspects of data cleaning, post research update.

I have dedicated some time every once a while to the development of this system imagined in the next couple of years. I got to say, there is a distinct kind of fun from the development than from a research project. In research, the excitement a lot of time is from finally understanding something or figuring out a solution, the aspiration arrives as a nice surprise after reading and verifying into the data. While when it comes to development, the joy of satisfaction arives gradually. With every line of new codes written, I feel I get a little bit close to this.

The project is no near to finish yet and by no means I am trying to develop a well optimized product level system. While the skeleton is there and indeed make my life easier in research (especially when a lot of the research is done at personal time out of curiosity). 

### What do I need <a name="need"></a>

modularized

1. pre data - api
2. tools, likely use existing tools - modularization. Historical backtest. No gaurantee, but do
3. monitor new clues about effective paper trading. 

automate as much as possible to focus on the main part of the research.
