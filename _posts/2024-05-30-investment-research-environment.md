### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The idea emerged a couple of years ago when I started to have some research results and hoped to do more! Wouldn't it be amazing to have a system to scale on monitoring existing research result and facilitating new research? As much as I hate to admit, investment research, to me, is not only about the excitement of thinking and experimenting with solution of puzzles. There is also a quite heavy aspects of data cleaning, post research update

I have dedicated some time every once a while to the development of this system imagined. I got to say, there is a distinct kind of fun from the development than from a research project. In research, the excitement a lot of times is from the 

systematic solution.

Cycle of research 

1. pre data - api
2. tools, likely use existing tools - modularization. Historical backtest. No gaurantee, but do
3. monitor new clues about effective paper trading. 

automate as much as possible to focus on the main part of the research.
