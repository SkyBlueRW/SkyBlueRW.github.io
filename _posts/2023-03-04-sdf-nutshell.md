### P = E(mx) <a name="introduction"></a>

It all starts with $$P_t = E_t(m_{t+1}x_{t+1})$$! At the heart of many interesting topics in finance such as factor pricing models, market anomalies, return preidiction, business regimes..etc lies this fundamental asset pricing formula. 

Isn't it amazing that with such a neat equation based on minimum assumptions (as little as law of one price), we can price all future payoffs $$x_{t+1}$$ with a stochastic discount factor $$m_{t+1}$$. Through the len of the paradigm with stochastic discount factor, we can extend insights across asset classes from different perspectives such as macro, consumption, production...
