It's really not a rare situation in investment research, that one read into a new paper detailing about a new anomaly that can predict the cross sectional stock return. You try to replicate it and enhance it in terms of a alpha signal with the arsenal of all kinds of modification. While it does not work out of sample in a paper trading despite the amazing performance delivered historically. What's wrong?

actually, there are hundreds of factors claim to predict cross-section stock return. A lot of times, (quantitative) investors would have trading signal 


When we research the data set intensively and experiments hundreds of factors, the baseline is no more none of them work. Significant result can emerge just out of randomness. Take the coin toss guess as analogy, it's quite unlikely for one people to guess correctly for 10 consecutive times of coin toss, while if we find 10 thousands people, it is not surprising to see a few of them are able to guess correctly out of luck not from skills in guessing coin toss.
