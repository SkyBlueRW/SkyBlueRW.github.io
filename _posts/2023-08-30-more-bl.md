### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Forecasting expected return is a rewarding but challenging exercise. One shot to attain some odds in this battle is probably to take into account of all relavant information available out there. In such cases, a reliable way to combine these information of distinct categories become quite crutial.

The Black-Litterman model provides one such solution. As discussed in the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)), the Bayesian franmework underlying the model takes all relavant information/forecast on expected return as variables with uncertainties and combined them in a Bayesian way to account for uncertainties.

Black-Litterman is a good start on this exploration of the Hellorefinement on expected return forecast, while there are way more to discuss along the road! In this blog, let's delve further into the practical consideration to put Black Litterman model in application and talk more conceptually on expected return forecast.

### The Practical Side of Black-Litterman <a name="practical"></a>

![BL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyBlueRW/SkyBlueRW.github.io/main/_posts/asset/bl.png)

Continuing our discussion on the Black-Litterman model from the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)). Without much assumptions placed so far, we got a refined forecast that combines all original forecast/information in the form of posterior.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}(\Sigma_{\pi}^{-1} \pi + P^T\Omega^{-1}Q) \\
M &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a general framework, with which, we are free to feed in all kinds of prior and investment view (likelihood) within the Gaussian world. While such a general model usually comes with a great deal of estimation required in application. For the two matrix measuring uncertainty ($$\Sigma_{\pi}$$ and $$\Omega$$) alone, we have $$N^2 + K^2$$ parameters to estimate. (N and K refers to number of securities in the universe and number of original forecast respectively). 

To faciliate the estimation and reduce the model risk originated from the large number of parameters, a lot of techniques with further restriction upon the Gassuan assumption are applied in application. Let's look into some of these techniques to put the Bayesian framwork in application.

#### The Black Litterman Tau <a name="subparagraph1"></a>

One original assumption that Black & Litterman themselves make is that the covariance matrix measuring uncertainty around prior ($$\Sigma_{\pi}$$) is proportional to return covariance matrix ($$\Sigma_{\pi} = \tau \Sigma$$). Instantly, the $$N^2$$ paramters requiring estimation boils to only one $$\tau$$. 

Obviously it is not the 'correct and accurate' assumption, while it does pick some points of the full picture and greatly reduce the tension on estimation. Higher volatility in security return generally means more difficulty in the estimation of expected return.  

With this assumption in place, we get the standard Black-Litterman estimation in the following form.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (\tau \Sigma + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}((\tau \Sigma)^{-1} \pi + P^T\Omega^{-1}Q) \\
M &= (\tau \Sigma + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

The scaling factor $$\tau$$ is all required to determine the unceratainty around prior now. What makes things a little complicated is that the standard error on the prior is not available as it is extracted from a reverse optimization rather than a statistical model. Generally, it is assigned heuristically with a small value close to 0 as "uncertainty in the mean is much smaller than the uncertainty in the return itself" (Black & Litterman (1992)). 

The argument is consistent with other ways proposed to set $$\tau$$. Either to take the uncertainty as sampling error ($$\tau = \dfrac{1}{T}$$) or imply it from holding in risky asset in reference portfolio ($$\tau = \dfrac{1}{w_{risky}} - 1$$) leads to $$\tau$$ at the range within 0 and 0.1. [Walters (2013)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1701467) provides a comprehensive review about seting $$\tau$$.


#### The Subjective Omega <a name="subparagraph2"></a>

With uncertainty around prior set with $$\tau$$, let's take a more detailed look into the determination of uncertainty around other investment views. specifically for the case of investment view from subjective view wihout direct way to specify forecast error. 

It is rather intuitive to set the uncertainty around investment views generated from statistical model. Forecasting errors (I.E. residual variance in a regression) are available to fit in the shoes easily in the case. What's not that intuitive is with investment views not generated in a quantitative way without forecast error right available. Subjective judgement acts as a significant information source for a lot of scenarios in investment. Additional efforts would be required to incorporate such subjective investment views.

Similarly to Black & Litterman's assumption on prior uncertainty, we can assume the uncertainty around other investment views is proportional to return variance as well. After all, it's the comparison between uncertainty that determines the weights of a particular investment view. For a subjective investment view k expressed as a linear portfolio ($$p_k$$), we can assume the uncertainty is scaled on the portfolio variance.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Omega &= \alpha P_k \Sigma P_k^T
\end{aligned}
$$

**Idozek Implied Confidence Level**

Idozek(2007) proposed a very intuitive way to infer $$\alpha$$ from percentage of confidence defined in terms of desired active deviation in weights. 

Depending on our confidence of one particular investment view k, the refined posterior mean range between $$\mu^{\star}_{0}$$ (in case of 0 confidence in the view/ $$\alpha \to \infty$$) and $$\mu^{\star}_{100}$$ (in case of absolute confidence in the view $$\alpha = 0$$). Correspondingly, the most confident portfolio $$x^{\star}_{100}$$ and most conservative portfolio $$x^{\star}_0$$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= \pi + \Sigma_{\pi}P_k^T(\Omega + P_k\Sigma_{\pi}P_k^T)^{-1} (Q-P_k\pi) \\
\mu^{\star}_{100} &= \pi + \tau\Sigma P_k^T (P_k\tau \Sigma P_k^T)^{-1}(Q - P_k\pi)\\
\mu^{\star}_0 &= \pi \\
x^{\star}_{100} &= (\lambda \Sigma)^{-1} \mu^{\star}_{100}\\
x^{\star}_0 &= (\lambda \Sigma)^{-1} \pi = x_0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

A confidence level (0% ~ 100%) can be defined in terms of the desired position ($$\hat{x}$$) between the two portfolios of $$x^{\star}_0$$ and $$x^{\star}_{100}$$.    

$$
\begin{aligned}
confidence &= \dfrac{\hat{x} - x^{\star}_0}{x^{\star}_{100} - x^{\star}_0} \\
\hat{x} &= x^{\star}_0 + confidence * (x^{\star}_{100} - x^{\star}_0) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

This is actually quite an intuive and consistent way to express confidence. For one hand, we are enabled the flexibility to express our confidence in percentage. For the other hand, this percentage of confidence is **linearly proportional to our active weight and risk**. As we increase our confidence from 0 to 100%, the active weight increases linearly from $$x^{\star}_0$$ to $$x^{\star}_{100}$$ so does the active risk.

Now things become much simpler. We turn our confidence on one investment view to a consistent portfolio. It's not that hard to infer the corresponding $$\omega$$ from it. Walters (2007) provides an analytical solution for this step.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dfrac{1}{1 + \alpha} &= \dfrac{\hat{x} - x^{\star}_0}{x^{\star}_{100} - x^{\star}_0} = confidence \\
&\downarrow \\
\alpha &= \dfrac{1 - confidence}{confidence} \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

For all investment views lacking clear uncertainty defined already, we can iterate this process and get its $$\omega$$. With the Idozek implied confidence level technique, the BL can expand to a lot more use cases.

**Haesen, Hallerbach, Markwat & Molenaar tau/alpha ratio**

For the use case of asset allocation, Haesen, Hallerbach, Markwat & Molenaar (2017) proposed to additionaly assume the availability of only absolute view on all securities and directly define the ratio of $$\dfrac{\tau}{\alpha}$$ rather then define them separately. With the additional restriction, P becomes an identity matrix leads to significant simplification of the refinement.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &= I_N \\
&\downarrow \\
\mu^{\star} &= (1 + \dfrac{\tau}{\alpha})^{-1} (\pi + \dfrac{\tau}{\alpha}Q) \\
M &= (\tau^{-1} + \alpha^{-1}) \Sigma
\end{aligned}
$$

Now what matters in the mix of investment views is the ratio $$\dfrac{\tau}{\alpha}$$. The weights placed on the investment views is **linearly proportional to the ratio**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha \to 0 (\dfrac{\tau}{\alpha} \to \infty)\\
\mu^{\star} &= Q\\
M &\to 0\\
\alpha = \tau  (\dfrac{\tau}{\alpha} = \dfrac{1}{2})\\
\mu^{\star} &= \dfrac{1}{2} (Q + \pi) \\
M &= \dfrac{1}{2} \tau \Sigma \\
\alpha \to \infty (\dfrac{\tau}{\alpha} \to 0)\\
\mu^{\star} &= \pi \\
M &= \tau \Sigma \\
\end{aligned}
$$


### More on Expected Return Forecast <a name="more"></a>

from statistical perspective, it is a classical Bayesian model of known variance and unknown mean

**flow**

- open. very useful to combine forecast
- look further. practical choice
- no update on covariance -> \tau not necessary
- strategy a challenge task, the hope rely on combine multiple information source. from a finance perspective, different information for different horizon. from a statistical perspective, return for high variance, diversified information bagging/ensemble. 


calibration

- tau
- specifically omega
- specify omega in terms of tau for subjective view / Idozek. Active risk proportional
- boils down to shrink / with risk parity

BL think uncertainty in mean return is much smaller than uncertainty in return. tau should be small
