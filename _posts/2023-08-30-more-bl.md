### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Forecasting expected return is a rewarding but challenging exercise. One shot to attain some odds in this battle is probably to take into account of all relavant information available. In such case, a reliable way to combine these information of distinct categories become quite crutial.

The Black-Litterman Model provide one such solution. As discussed in the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)), the Bayesian franmework underlying the model take all relavant information/forecast on expected return as variables with uncertainties and combined them in a Bayesian way to account for uncertainty.

Black-Litterman is a good start on this journey of refinement of expected return forecast, while there are way more to discuss along the road! In this blog, let's delve further into the practical application of the Black Litterman model and talk more conceptually on expected return forecast.

### The Practical Side of Black-Litterman <a name="practical"></a>

![BL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyBlueRW/SkyBlueRW.github.io/main/_posts/asset/bl.png)

Continuing our discussion on the Black-Litterman model from the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)). Without much assumptions placed so far, we got the refined forecast on expected reutrn in the form of following posterior distribution. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}(\Sigma_{\pi}^{-1} \pi + P^T\Omega^{-1}Q) \\
M &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a very general framework, with which, we are free to model our original forecasts in the Gaussian world. While a general model usually comes with a great deal of estimation required in application. For the two matrix measuring uncertainty ($$\Sigma_{\pi}$$ and $$\Omega$$) alone, we have $$N^2 + K^2$$ parameters to estimate. (N and K refers to number of securities in the universe and number of original forecast respectively). 

To faciliate the estimation and reduce the model risk originated from the large number of parameters, a lot of techniques with further restriction upon the Gassuan assumption are usually applied in the application. Let's look into some of the techniques to put the Bayesian framwork to application.

- open. very useful to combine forecast
- look further. practical choice
- no update on covariance -> \tau not necessary

The forecast of expected return stands as the most critical and challenging task in the investment management. .

In a previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)), we have discussed the bayesian framework underlying the Black-Litterman Model to combine various forecast on top of 

last BL, not mention calibration of variance related parameters. this blog talks about the calibration in practice. furthermore, this strategy of combine information underlying BL.

- tau
- specifically omega
- specify omega in terms of tau for subjective view / Idozek. Active risk proportional
- boils down to shrink / with risk parity

\mu^{\star}_{100} &= \pi + \tau\Sigma P^T (P\tau \Sigma P^T)^{-1}(Q - P\pi)\\
\mu^{\star}_0 &= \pi
\end{aligned}

$$
\begin{aligned}

x^{\star}_0 &= (\lambda \Sigma)^{-1} \pi = x_0\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Idzorek specify confidence in terms of weight. Also in terms of active risk. Back out w required for this deviation. solving for w with least squares method.

\begin{aligned}

\Omega &= \alpha P\SigmaP^T \\
\downarrow & \mu^{\star} = \pi + \tau \SigmaP^T(\Omega + \tauP\SigmaP^T)^{-1} (Q-P\pi) \\
\mu^{\star} &= \pi + \dfrac{1}{1 + \alpha}(P^{-1}Q - \pi)\\
\hat{x} &= (\lambda \Sigma)^{-1} (\pi + \dfrac{1}{1 + \alpha}(P^{-1}Q - \pi))\\
\end{aligned}

tau

BL think uncertainty in mean return is much smaller than uncertainty in return. tau should be small
