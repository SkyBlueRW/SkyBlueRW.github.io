### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Forecasting expected return is a rewarding but challenging exercise. One shot to attain some odds in this battle is probably to take into account of all relavant information available there. In such case, a reliable way to combine these information of distinct categories become quite crutial.

The Black-Litterman Model provide one such solution. As discussed in the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)), the Bayesian franmework underlying the model take all relavant information/forecast on expected return as variables with uncertainties and combined them in a Bayesian way to account for uncertainty.

Black-Litterman is a good start on this exploration of refinement on expected return forecast, while there are way more to discuss along the road! In this blog, let's delve further into the practical application of the Black Litterman model and talk more conceptually on expected return forecast.

### The Practical Side of Black-Litterman <a name="practical"></a>

![BL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkyBlueRW/SkyBlueRW.github.io/main/_posts/asset/bl.png)

Continuing our discussion on the Black-Litterman model from the previous blog ([Anchor Your Forecast the Bayesian Way](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/07/27/anchor-forecast-bayesian.html)). Without much assumptions placed so far, we got the refined forecast combined from all original forecast/information in the form of posterior.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}(\Sigma_{\pi}^{-1} \pi + P^T\Omega^{-1}Q) \\
M &= (\Sigma_{\pi} + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a general framework, with which, we are free to feed in all kinds of prior and investment view (likelihood) within the Gaussian world. While such a general model usually comes with a great deal of estimation required in application. For the two matrix measuring uncertainty ($$\Sigma_{\pi}$$ and $$\Omega$$) alone, we have $$N^2 + K^2$$ parameters to estimate. (N and K refers to number of securities in the universe and number of original forecast respectively). 

To faciliate the estimation and reduce the model risk originated from the large number of parameters, a lot of techniques with further restriction upon the Gassuan assumption are applied in application. Let's look into some of these techniques to put the Bayesian framwork to application.

#### The Black Litterman Tau <a name="subparagraph1"></a>

One original assumption that Black & Litterman make is that the covariance matrix measuring uncertainty around prior ($$\Sigma_{\pi}$$) is proportional to return covariance matrix ($$\Sigma_{\pi} = \tau \Sigma$$). Instantly, the $$N^2$$ paramters requiring estimation boils to only one $$\tau$$. 

Obviously it is not the 'correct and accurate' assumption, while it does pick some points of the full picture and greatly reduce the tension on estimation. Higher volatility in security return generally means more difficulty in the estimation of expected return.  

With this assumption in place, we get the standard Black-Litterman estimation in the following form.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (\tau \Sigma + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}((\tau \Sigma)^{-1} \pi + P^T\Omega^{-1}Q) \\
M &= (\tau \Sigma + P^T\Omega^{-1}P)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

The scaling factor $$\tau$$ is all required to determine the unceratainty around prior now. What makes things a little complicated is that the standard error on the prior is not available as it is extracted from a reverse optimization rather than a statistical model. Generally, it is assigned heuristically with a small value close to 0 as "uncertainty in the mean is much smaller than the uncertainty in the return itself" (Black & Litterman (1992)). 

The argument is consistent with other ways proposed to set $$\tau$$. Either to take the uncertainty as sampling error ($$\tau = \dfrac{1}{T}$$) or imply it from holding in risky asset in reference portfolio ($$\tau = \dfrac{1}{w_{risky}} - 1$$) leads to $$\tau$$ at the range within 0 and 0.1. [Walters (2013)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1701467) provides a comprehensive review about seting $$\tau$$.


#### The Subjective Omega <a name="subparagraph2"></a>

With uncertainty around prior set with $$\tau$$, next is with investment view.

Haesen, Hallerbach, Markwat & Molenaar (2017): Enhancing Risk Parity By Including Views

$$
\begin{aligned}
P &= I_N \\
\Omega &= \alpha \Sigma \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu^{\star} &= (1 + \dfrac{\tau}{\alpha})^{-1} (\pi + \dfrac{\tau}{\alpha}Q) \\
M &= (\tau^{-1} + \alpha^{-1}) \ Sigma
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\alpha &\to 0 \\
\mu^{\star} &= Q \\
M &\to 0\\
\alpha &\to \infty \\
\mu^{\star} &= \pi \\
M &= \tau \Sigma \\
\alpha &= \tau \\
\mu^{\star} &= \dfrac{1}{2} (Q + \pi) \\
M &= \dfrac{1}{2} \tau \Sigma
\end{aligned}
$$



### More on Expected Return Forecast <a name="more"></a>

from statistical perspective, it is a classical Bayesian model of known variance and unknown mean

**flow**

- open. very useful to combine forecast
- look further. practical choice
- no update on covariance -> \tau not necessary
- strategy a challenge task, the hope rely on combine multiple information source. from a finance perspective, different information for different horizon. from a statistical perspective, return for high variance, diversified information bagging/ensemble. 


calibration

- tau
- specifically omega
- specify omega in terms of tau for subjective view / Idozek. Active risk proportional
- boils down to shrink / with risk parity

Idzorek specify confidence in terms of weight. Also in terms of active risk. Back out w required for this deviation. solving for w with least squares method.

tau

BL think uncertainty in mean return is much smaller than uncertainty in return. tau should be small
