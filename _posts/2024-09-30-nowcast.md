### The "Big Hit" <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid Pandemic.

The Covid recession is probably unlike any economic downturn in the history. While most recessions are driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession is triggered by a global health crisis. Without much alarm, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

For one hand, this shock was reflected dramatically in macroeconomic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummeted to 41, far below the contraction threshold of 50. A clear fat-tail event. For the other hand, the sectoral pattern in economic activities are significantly dfferent than other time. Sectors typically seen as acyclical like service and consumption experience larger contraction; employment no longer lags production ... etc. Let alone the goverment transfered an unprecedented amount of liquidity to the private sector. All in all, a general model without further adjusting for these amonalies is not blessed to work with it!

The question that arises is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such extreme shocks? How can we produce reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers valuable insights into tackling these challenges.

The New York Fed initially introduced its first generation nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, a new, more robust version of the model was released, designed to better handle such data fluctuations. Time to take a look at what has changed.

### Here Comes the Change <a name="change"></a>

To appreciate the improvements, let's first review the original model.

The first version is actually a fairly standard dynamic factor model. Macroeconomic indicators are modeled through two components: comovement latent factors $$f_t$$ and idyosyncratic disturbance $$\epsilon_t$$, both of which follow autoregressive process with invariant Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions are applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure as well as to incporate quarterly data in a monthly flow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

The benefit of such a parsimonious linear system under Gaussian assmuption is clear. The simple structure make it invulnerable to estimation uncertainties and the Gaussian assumption make relavant calculation tractable, ensuring analytical convenience. 

While like every model, it does have its own limitation, which make it ill equied in an extreme time like Covid Recession. The scale and the unique pattern of the Covid recession overwhelm such a system defined in invariant parameters. The dramatic fluctuation with abnormal sectoral structure flood into the estimation of every parameter and tweak the way that information in macroeconomic indicators is interpreted and utilized. Making matters even worse, the parameters of the model are re-estimated every quarter with a rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

Given this context, it's not that surprising that the New York Fed suspended the first generation of their model shortly after the oneset of Covid-19 for a much-needed update. The new version is still a dynamic factor model but now comes with significantly more structures to account for the quickly evaluated volatility and shifted sectoral structure.

The most crucial update, in my opinion, is probably the explicit incorporation of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustment to deal with the quickly elevated fluctuations in the crisis. Rather than Gaussian noise with invariant variance, the new version of model introduces the time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) to account for changing volatilities and discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) that can take value between 1 and 5 to further scale fluctuation up when necessary.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, this update drives the model beyond the Gaussian linear realm, but the benefit is also substantial. It helps to guard against excessive emphasis on the high fluctuation period. After all, volatility is the ruler in the estimation and prediction. Falsified volatility estimate from local hike would inevitably mess up with every parameters estimated and forecast made. 

By incorporaring time-varying volatility, the model better handles such large fluctuations. An extreme movement in one macroeconomic series can now be attributed to a spike in that series' idiosyncratic volatility. Similarly, widespread fluctuations across multiple series may signal rising volatility in the latent factors driving them. The discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) further enhance the model's ability to respond to extreme events, allowing for volatility amplification by product. As a result, a sharp and quick flutuation like Covid recession would be interpreted more in terms of the local information, avoiding exaggerated impact on other time.

Both Global factor and Soft factor went down significantly during Covid recession. Especially, the drop of Global factor during Covid recession is much worse compared to two previous recessions of dotcom bubble (2002) and Financial Crisis (2008). Quite interstingly,  

The evolution of facotr volatility and outlier also demonstrate intersting facts. There is not a significant uptick of factor volatility for both factors. With log variance constrained in a random walk process, the volatility is unlikely to be far from the previous value, driving the extreme fluctuation mostly to

explicit modeling of heterogeneous dynamics and fat tails changed the interpretation

Given a newly released economic indicator i, The new forecast of corresponding factors ($$E(f_{tk}|\Sigma_2)$$) are updated with correction of forecast on this indicator ($$y_{i,t} - E(y_{i,t}|\Sigma_1)$$) scaled by $$w_{i,t}$$. $$w_{i,t}$$ is calculated with covariance and variance of factors and disturbance with a similar form to $$\dfrac{cov_t(y_{i,t}, f_{tk})}{var(f_{tk} + var(\epsilon_{i,t})}$$ and decides the sign and size of the impact of the newly released indicator. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(f_{tk}|\Sigma_2) - E(f_{tk}|\Sigma_1) = w_{i,t} (y_{i,t} - E(y_{i,t}|\Sigma_1))
\end{aligned}
