### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the remarkable capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to digest and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid.

The Covid recession was unlike any economic downturn in the human history. Unlike past recessions generally driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much warning, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

The impact was stark in macroeconomic data: it's a 28% reduction of US GDP in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The US lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummet to 41, well below the contraction threshold of 50. Clearly it is a fat tail event that would mess up with our models.

Now the question is what should we do. How can we adapt to such an unprecedented shock so that we can arrive at reasonable estimates during Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update on their nowcasting model offers an excellent opportunity to explore it.

The New York Fed introduced its first generation of nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. The model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, the New York Fed released a more robust version designed to better handle data volatility. Let's take a closer look at what has changed.


### Before Pandemic <a name="introduction"></a>

To delve into what's changed, let's first have a look at what's it originally like. 

Broadly, the first version is a quite general model. The macro data series are modeled with both the comovement - latent factor $$f_t$$ and the idyosyncratic $$\epsilon_t$$, both are further modelled in auto regressive fasions with Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$).



$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$


### The change

explicit modeling of dynamic volatility and extreme. change in soft not that large? captured in covid. meaningful in terms of uncertainty.

nonlinear element. account for the fact of normal

**add the covid factor**



Other than it works really well, new source of unvertainty

long term growth trend of US real GDP, loads only on the US real GDP. Not expict since 1985. But might be important considering that it is expanding on estimation data.

non-diagonal 


messing up the estimation. simply trim them out is not a good idea, as they come with meaniful economic content. 

how to treat

Covid recession is fundamentally different than other recessions

Pandemic is unprecedented event.

suspension Sep 2021

Covid factor - different comovement identified.
