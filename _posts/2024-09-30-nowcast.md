### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid Pandemic.

The Covid recession was probably unlike any economic downturn in the history. While previous were typically driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much warning, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

This shock was reflected starkly in macro economic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI feel to 41, well below the contraction threshold of 50. This was clearly a fat-tail event - one that would disrupt even the most well-designed models.

The key question now is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such unprecedented shocks? How can we arrive at reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers a valuable opportunity to explore these challenges.

The New York Fed initially introduced its first generation nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, the New York Fed released a more robust version designed to better handle data volatility. Let's take a closer look at what has changed.


### The Model Before Covid <a name="before"></a>

To understand their improvements, let's first have a quick lookt at the original model.

The first version was a fairly standard dynamic factor model. It modeled macroeconomic time series through two components: a comovement compornent - $$f_t$$ and the idyosyncratic component $$\epsilon_t$$, both of which followed autoregressive process with Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions were applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ so that latent factors only linked to their corresponding macro series to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Essentially, this was a parsimonious linear system with Gaussian uncertainties. The simplicity of the linear structure helped reduced estimation variance, providing stability to the model. The assumption of Gaussian uncertainties made the calculation process tractable, offering significant computational convenience. This approach probably worked well for probably 99% of the time, but not in an extreme situation.

With such a paradighm, a 31% GDP drop is obviously a fat tail event - an occurrence so improbable that it heavily skews the estimation, rendering the corresponding period disproportionately influential. The system built to process gradual, normal changes was now flooded with extrem volatility, leading to unreliable estimates. What's worse, the parameters of the model are re-estimated every quarter with rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

With this context, it's not surprising to see New York Fed's suspended the first generation of model and look out for an update.

### Here comes the change <a name="change"></a>

So what have they changed in the newer robust model!

explicit modeling of dynamic volatility and extreme. change in soft not that large? captured in covid. meaningful in terms of uncertainty.

nonlinear element. account for the fact of normal

**add the covid factor**



Other than it works really well, new source of unvertainty

long term growth trend of US real GDP, loads only on the US real GDP. Not expict since 1985. But might be important considering that it is expanding on estimation data.

non-diagonal 


messing up the estimation. simply trim them out is not a good idea, as they come with meaniful economic content. 

how to treat

Covid recession is fundamentally different than other recessions

Pandemic is unprecedented event.

suspension Sep 2021

Covid factor - different comovement identified.
