### The "Big Hit" <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capability of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid Pandemic.

The Covid recession is probably unlike any economic downturn in the history. While most recessions are driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession is triggered by a global health crisis. Without much alarm, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

For one hand, this shock was reflected dramatically in macroeconomic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummeted to 41, far below the contraction threshold of 50. A clear fat-tail event. For the other hand, the sectoral behaviors of economics are significantly dfferent than other time. Sectors typically seen as acyclical like service and consumption experience large contraction; employment no longer lags production ... etc. Let alone the goverment transfered an unprecedented amount of liquidity to the private sector. All in all, a general model without further adjusting for these amonalies is not blessed to work!

The question that arises is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such extreme shocks? How can we produce reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers valuable insights into tackling these challenges.

The New York Fed initially introduced its first generation nowcasting model back in April 2016 to provide weekly nowcast on US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, a new, more robust version of the model was released, designed to better handle such data fluctuations. Time to take a look at what has changed.

### Here Comes the Change <a name="change"></a>

To appreciate the improvements, let's first review the original model.

The first version was a fairly standard dynamic factor model. It modeled macroeconomic time series through two components: comovement latent factors $$f_t$$ and idyosyncratic components $$\epsilon_t$$, both of which follow autoregressive process with invariant Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions were applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure as well as to incporate quarterly data in a monthly flow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

This is essentially a parsimonious linear system with Gaussian uncertainties. The simplicity of the model reduced estimation variance and provided stability. The assumption of Gaussian uncertainties made the calculation process quite tractable, ensuring computational convenience. This approach should work well under normal conditions, but is ill-equiped to handle extreme situations.

With such a paradighm of distributions with invariant paramters, a period of 31% GDP drop is evitably treated as an extreme outlier - an occurrence so improbable that it heavily skews the estimation, rendering the corresponding period disproportionately influential. Making matters even worse, the parameters of the model are re-estimated every quarter with a rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

Given this context, it's not that surprising that the New York Fed suspended the first generation of their model shortly after the oneset of Covid-19 for a much-needed update.


So what does the updated model look like? It's still a dynamic factor model but now comes with significantly more structures.

The most crucial update, in my opinion, is the explicit incorporation of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustment. In the original model, both latent factors and idiosyncratic components were modeled with Gaussian noise of invariant variance. The new version, on the other hand, introduces the time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) to account for changing volatilities and discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) that can take value between 1 and 5 to further scale volatility up when necessary.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, this update drives the model beyond the Gaussian linear realm, but the benefit is also substantial. It helps to guard against excessive emphasis on the high fluctuation period. With the original model, when a major fluctuation like Covide affected multiple macroeconomic series, the impact would disproportionately shift to the estimation of the latent factors, since this part of the model bears most flexibility for variation by design.

This does not seem to align with the real story. Markets operate under continously changing distributions, occasionally punctuated by sudden jumps of shocks. Recent economic downturns should reveal more about the local information of that particular moment rather than tell a story about the long term unconditional trend, which is driven by other forces like population growth and productivity. 

By incorporaring time-varying volatility, the model better handles such large fluctuations. An extreme movement in one macroeconomic series can now be (partly) attributed to a spike in that series' idiosyncratic volatility. Similarly, widespread fluctuations across multiple series may signal rising volatility in the latent factors driving them. The discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) further enhance the model's ability to respond to extreme events, allowing for volatility amplification by product. As a result, the estimation is less prone to a short period with significant fluctuations.

Leaving the complexity of estimation required by nonlinearity aside for the moment. Almuzara, Baker, O'Keeffe & Sbordone (2023) presented the evolution of latent facotor, factor volatility and outlier for all 5 latent factor they specified. Below I have cut the Global Factor (load on all macroeconomic series) and Soft Factor (load on survey type macro economic series) as illustrations.

Both Global factor and Soft factor went down significantly during Covid recession. Especially, the drop of Global factor during Covid recession is much worse compared to two previous recessions of dotcom bubble (2002) and Financial Crisis (2008). Quite interstingly,  

The evolution of facotr volatility and outlier also demonstrate intersting facts. There is not a significant uptick of factor volatility for both factors. With log variance constrained in a random walk process, the volatility is unlikely to be far from the previous value, driving the extreme fluctuation mostly to

y_t & = \mu + l g_t + \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
