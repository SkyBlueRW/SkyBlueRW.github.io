### The "Big Hit" <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the impressive capabilities of a dynamic factor model based nowcasting system to process and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. However, even such powerful models struggle when confronted with a once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid recession.

The Covid recession is probably unlike any economic downturn in history. While most recessions are driven by economic cycles or financial uncertainties, the Covid recession was triggered by a global health crisis. Without much alarm, Covid struck at an unprecendented scale. Factories and stores shut down, and the economy came to an abrupt halt.

This shock was reflected starkly in macroeconomic data: US GDP dropped by 31.4% in Q2 2020 - the largest drop since World War II. The country lost 20.5 million (13% of total non-farm) non-farm jobs in April 2020, wiping out 9-year of job growth. The ISM manufactory PMI plummeted to 41, far below the contraction threshold of 50. A clear fat-tail event that would mess up the estimation of a model. Additionally, the sectoral pattern of economic activities was highly unusual even compared to other crisis. Sectors typically seen as acyclical such as service and consumption experienced larger contraction, employment no longer lags production ... etc. Let alone the unprecedented liquidity transfers from the government. Traditional models are not well equiped to handle such an anomaly!

The question that arises is: how can we adapt our models to handdle such extreme shocks? How can we produce reasonable estimation during crises like Covid while avoiding excessive post-crisis volatility? The New York Fed's update to their nowcasting model offers valuable insights into tackling these challenges.

Initially introduced in April 2016, the New York Fed's nowcasting model provided weekly nowcast of US GDP. However, the model was suspended in September 2021 due to "unprecedented fluctuations in many input series during the COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to estimating the model". Two years later, in September 2023, a new, more robust version of the model was released, designed to better handle such extrem period. Let's take a closer look at what has changed.

### Here Comes the Change <a name="change"></a>

To appreciate the improvements, let's first review the original model.

The original version is a fairly standard dynamic factor model. Macroeconomic indicators are modeled through two components: the comovement latent factors $$f_t$$ and the idyosyncratic disturbance $$\epsilon_t$$, both following autoregressive process with invariant Gassuan noise ($$u_t, e_{i,t}$$). Restrictions are applied on the loading matrix $$\Lambda$$ to reflect the cross-sectional correlation structure as well as to incporate quarterly data in a monthly flow. The benefit of this parsimonious linear system under Gaussian assumption is clear. The simple structure reduces estimation uncertainties and the Gaussian assumption make relavant calculation tractable, ensuring analytical convenience. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

While like every model, it does have its own limitation, which make it ill-equied in an extreme time like Covid Recession. The sheer scale and unique pattern of the Covid recession overwhelm such a system defined in invariant parameters. The dramatic fluctuation with abnormal sectoral structure flood into the estimation of every parameter and tweak the way that information in macroeconomic indicators is interpreted and utilized. Making matters even worse, the parameters of the model are re-estimated every quarter with a rolling 15 years of data. The rabit hole is gonna to be there for the next 15 years!

Given this context, it's not that surprising that the New York Fed suspended this first generation of model shortly after the oneset of Covid-19 for a much-needed update. The new version remains a dynamic factor model but now incorporates significant structural changes to better handle quickly evolving volatility and shifted sectoral dynamics.


**Stochastic Volatility and outlier adjustment**

The most crucial update, in my opinion, is probably the explicit incorporation of stochastic volatility and outlier adjustment to manage the jumping flucuations during the crisis. Instead of relying on Gaussian noise with invariant variance, the new version of model introduces the time-varying volatilities ($$\sigma_{ft}, \sigma_{\epsilon t}$$) to account for changing level of volatility and discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) that can take value between 1 and 5 to further scale fluctuation up at extreme fluctuations.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_t&= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_4 f_{t-4} + \sigma_{ft} \odot s_{ft} \odot e_{ft} \\
\epsilon_t&= \alpha \epsilon_{t-1} + \sigma_{\epsilon t} \odot s_{\epsilon t} \odot e_{\epsilon t}\\
ln \sigma_{ft}^2 &= ln \sigma_{f,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{ft} \\
ln \sigma_{\epsilon t}^2 &= ln \sigma_{\epsilon,t-1}^2 + r_f \odot v_{\epsilon t} \\
v_{ft} &\sim N(0, I) \\
e_{\epsilon t} &\sim N(0, I)
\end{aligned}
$$

Clearly, this update pushs the model beyond the Gaussian linear realm, but the benefit is also substantial. It helps to guard against excessive emphasis on the high fluctuation period. After all, volatility is the ruler in all estimation and prediction. Falsified volatility estimate from local hike would inevitably mess up with every parameter estimated and forecast made. By incorporaring time-varying volatility, the model better handles large fluctuations. 

An extreme movement in one macroeconomic series can now be attributed to a spike in that series' idiosyncratic volatility. Similarly, widespread fluctuations across multiple series may signal rising volatility in the latent factors driving them. The discrete outliers ($$s_{ft}, s_{\epsilon t}$$) further enhance the model's ability to respond to extreme events, allowing for volatility amplification by product. As a result, a sharp and quick flutuation like Covid recession would be interpreted more in terms of the local information, avoiding exaggerated impact on other time.

**Factor Structure**

Another significant change is the introduction of a "Covid factor" to capture the unique economic dynamics of the pandemic. This factor was active only from March to September 2020, and it affected most economic indicators, except inflation.

Maroz, Stock & Watson(2021) found that despite the different pattern, scale and timing of the Covid recession and its immediate aftermath, a single Covid factor can explain much of the unique comovement during the Covid time. They found that such a Covid factor is significant from Mar to June 2020 and phase away afterward, generally alined with New York Fed's choice from March to September. With the Covid factor, the unique structure of the Covid recession is mostly remained for the Covid period hence we are not asking traditional questions on this exaggerated data.

This is vividly demonstrated in the evolution of latent factors and volatility plots. After adding the Covid factor, the extreme fluctuation observed in global factors that load on all macroeconomic indicators is absorbed from the Soft factor that loads on survey indicators into the newly added Covid factor, illustrating the varied responses of different indicators to the pandemic.

Additionally, the New York Fed has added a long-term growth trend factor, which only loads on GDP and GDI indicators, to capture changes in long-term growth.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t & = \mu + l g_t + \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
g_t &= g_{t-1} + r_g v_{gt} \\
v_{gt} & \sim N(0,1)
\end{aligned}
$$

Just based on the estimation of the long term trend for the past 15 years, the demand of adding such a factor is not urgent. The long term growth rate stays around 2.6% with a relatively wide 90% probability band. The impact will be limted even without this long term growth factor.

The intent is probably to have more data used for the estimation. With all the new structure added. It becomes both natural and important to load more data in the estimation. For one hand, the model is now well equited to accomodate special periods in the past characterized by high fluctuation. For the other, the significant more parateters and non-Gaussian feature require more data for reliable estimation. 

This is exactly what New York Fed has done in their model update. Rather than using rolling 15 years of data for estimation, they swithced to the whole sample for the estimation. The nececeity of dealing with diferent long term growth rate start to revel with a longer and growing data set.
