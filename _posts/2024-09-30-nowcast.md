### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In a previous blog [Nowcasting: The News From Jagged Economic Data](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/05/25/news-from-ragged-data.html), we explored the remarkable capabilities of a dynamic factor model-based nowcasting system to consume and interpret the irregular flow of macroeconomic data. While such a powerful model still struggles heavily when confronted with the once-in-a-century (if not once-in-a-millennium) crisis - the Covid.

From a variety of aspects, Covid recession is unlike any economic downturns of human history. Rather than economic uncertainty, the Covid recesion was spwaned from a globe wide healthy-crisis. Without much omen, the Covid hit in a unprecedented scale, factories and stores stopped, the economy hit a stop sign all at a sudden.

The update of the New York Fed Staff Nowcasting provides an excellent opportunity to learn. New York Fed releases its first generation of nowcasting forecast on US GDP .

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t &= \mu + \Lambda f_t + \epsilon_t \\
f_t &= A_1 f_{t-1} + ... + A_p f_{t-p} + u_t \\ 
\epsilon_{i,t} &= \alpha_i \epsilon_{i, t-1} + ... + e_{i,t} \\ 
u_t &\sim N(0, Q) \\
e_{i, t} &\sim N(0, I)

### The change

explicit modeling of dynamic volatility and extreme. change in soft not that large? captured in covid. meaningful in terms of uncertainty.

nonlinear element. account for the fact of normal

**add the covid factor**



Other than it works really well, new source of unvertainty

long term growth trend of US real GDP, loads only on the US real GDP. Not expict since 1985. But might be important considering that it is expanding on estimation data.

non-diagonal 


messing up the estimation. simply trim them out is not a good idea, as they come with meaniful economic content. 

how to treat

Covid recession is fundamentally different than other recessions

Pandemic is unprecedented event.

Covid factor - different comovement identified.
