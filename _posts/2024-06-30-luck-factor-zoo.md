As the Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase once said: "If you torture data long enough, it will confess to anything".

The other day, I was watching a documentary video that tells the story of a future trader who acheived 2500%+ profit within 5 years since 2019. Quite a magnificent financial reward! Though even the trader himself admitted, it's hard to determine if this should be attributed to exceptional skill or luck. The balance might tilt a bit more into the latter, especially considering the fact that almost all of his parterners exiting trading the same way due to unbearable losses.

Do these traders/portfolio managers/factors' nice historical performance come from something meaningful. Are they 

whether this factor/trader/pm with

Back in 90s, the publish of Fama French factor model unleash an era of factor research. Ever since, tens of thousands of factors claimed to predict cross sectional security return variations are published in all kinds of articles 
And it shouldn't be a surprise. Standing at 2024, the traditional data set such as market and fundamental data are investigated by too many researchers for too many trials. Quite naturally, tons of factors claimed to predict cross sectional security returns are there.

















It's really not a rare situation in investment research, that one read into a new paper detailing about a new anomaly that can predict the cross sectional stock return. You try to replicate it and enhance it in terms of a alpha signal with the arsenal of all kinds of modification. While it does not work out of sample in a paper trading despite the amazing performance delivered historically. What's wrong?

actually, there are hundreds of factors claim to predict cross-section stock return. A lot of times, (quantitative) investors would have trading signal 


When we research the data set intensively and experiments hundreds of factors, the baseline is no more none of them work. Significant result can emerge just out of randomness. Take the coin toss guess as analogy, it's quite unlikely for one people to guess correctly for 10 consecutive times of coin toss, while if we find 10 thousands people, it is not surprising to see a few of them are able to guess correctly out of luck not from skills in guessing coin toss.
