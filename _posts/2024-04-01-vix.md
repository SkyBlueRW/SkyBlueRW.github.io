### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

There is the subtle feeling when reading into a 'small' yet delicate model like volatility index (VIX) at the era of roaring Generative AI models! It is definitely impressive and shocking to see how knowledge, judgement and beyond can be gained from Generative AI via matrix operations. While it does not reduce any bit of my admiration on a delicate structural model like VIX as well as the inspiration and think behind it. 

It started to me as a following read about portfolio drawdown control. In the previous blogs o [From Volatility to Maximum Drawdown](#https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/10/15/max-drawdown.html) and [Holding Discipline for Drawdown Control](#https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/12/31/drawdown-control.html)
