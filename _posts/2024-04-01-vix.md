### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

There is the subtle feeling when reading into a 'small' yet delicate model like volatility index (VIX) at the era of roaring Generative AI models! Like many others, I got shocked by the insights, judgement and beyond that can be gained from Generative AI via matrix operations involving hundreds of billions of parameters. While it does not reduce any of my admiration to the think and inspiration behind a delicate structural model like VIX. Still interesting to read into it :)

It actually started as a following read about portfolio drawdown control to me. In the previous blogs [From Volatility to Maximum Drawdown](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/10/15/max-drawdown.html) and [Holding Discipline for Drawdown Control](https://skybluerw.github.io/2023/12/31/drawdown-control.html), we discussed about the impact of some vital factors on the risk measure of maximum drawdown and how to control it given a (unconditional) return stochastic process. Obviously, we can do much more. As a market anticipation of future realized volatility, it is natural to link VIX to risk regime and further to performance of risky assets.

In this blog, let's get to the beauty of VIX. To talk more about its information content, the intuition and numerical aspects of its calculation.

### Market Expectation of future volatility under Q <a name="ma"></a>

So why bother to construct an index from options rather than look into one or a few options themselves? It is true that the premium of an option reflects views on future volatility of the underlying, while its sensitivity to volatility (vega) constantly changes as per the moneyness of the option. VIX provide the tool for stable exposure to volatility hence make the volatility as a asset class explicitly.

How to construct such a volatility index with invariant exposure to volatility. Demeterfi, Derman, Kamal & Zou (1999) prvoded the solution in a sell side research report back in 1999, which is the foundation of the famous CBOE VIX index nowdays.

The recepie lies in the pricing of a variance swap with payoff (V - K), where V is the future realized volatility ($$V = \frac{1}{T}\int_o^T\sigma^2(t,...)dt$$) and K is the predefined delivery price. The variance swap perfectly fit in the place for VIX index due to unchanged exposure to future volatility.
