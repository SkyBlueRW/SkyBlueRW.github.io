## Risk discipline for Drawdown Control

- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Reference](#ref)


continuously reallocating wealth between a risk asset distributed with Geometric Brownian Motion and a riskless asset.

For stochastic optimal control problems, the auxiliary optimal control problem is a convex relaxation of the original problem. In the case of stochastic minimization problems, the relaxation gives provable lower bounds on the true optimal value
